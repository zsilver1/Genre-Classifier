This repository contains scripts and data for machine learning project by Sindhuula Selvaraju and Zachary Silver.
This repository contains 2 directories:
    1. Data : Raw and parsed data files
    2. Code : Scripts to parse and classify data and compute prediction accuracy

Usage:
    
Points to note:
    1. The preprocessing/parsing of our raw data involves removing frequently occuriing words and phrases and making sure keywords necessary for the classification get a higher weight
    2. The feature vector is formd similar to the way it waas formed in our homeworks but instead of integer our features are strings
    3. We're still using the model and predict files to keep track of possible points of failure.
Thinking points:
    1. Should we also consider synonyms of words example a summary in the training dataa for a horror novel may have thee word scared but a horror novel in the test data may have the word afraid.
